The most common use case is to mount the root filesystem, like when it’s encrypted and you need to type a passphrase to mount it. Or if fsck needs to run on an unclean root filesystem. Basically anything that goes before mounting the root filesystem and, after that, before launching INIT (you can read more in the Debian Wiki).</description></item><item><title>Ip Tunnel Over Ssh With Tun</title><link>https://www.marcfargas.com/2008/07/ip-tunnel-over-ssh-with-tun/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2008 10:14:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcfargas.com/2008/07/ip-tunnel-over-ssh-with-tun/</guid><description>Today I had some connection problems in one of our offices, so I needed to connect in some alternative way. A good moment for experimenting&amp;hellip; The alternative connection was my laptop acting as a router connected with my mobile phone via bluetooth.
The problem&amp;rsquo;s come with the VPN connections, IPSec is nice, but you can hate it on lots of things&amp;hellip; i.e. all tunnels are setup using static ip addresses so in order to use the alternate connection (dynamic IP) I need to change the ipsec config of the other offices.</description></item></channel></rss>
